Glove Linux Driver Quick Start
------------------------------

1. run install.sh in the install folder
(this will copy the shared objects and header files into the correct directory)

2. go to folder "consolesample" and execute "sudo ./testglove /dev/usb/hiddev0"

In testglove.cpp you will that 5000 samples are read from the driver, with 1 millisecond
delay between each sample. At the beginning of the program the packet rate
is printed out (typically 75Hz), so at the moment we are taking more samples per second
from the driver (1ms interval) than what is updated from the glove.
